J(ules') Diffie Hellman Implementation

A Diffie Hellman implementation using the Miracl library, for learin' purposes only. This was written late in 2006 (making me around 22 at the time), and I have 
no recollection/take zero responsibility for it ;)

Before committing, I've managed to successfully compile it against the latest (at the time of writing 7.0.0) version of miracl (https://github.com/CertiVox/MIRACL), 
'make' in the src directory should do it. On Linux, libbsd will be needed for arc4random (the original dev machine was running OpenBSD 3.8!). If I recall
a lot of this demo was later used in my MARs crypto crackme, the source to which I lost some time back.
